# Deep Learning Project

This repository contains code for a deep learning project with two parts (A and B) implementing custom CNN models.

## Recommended Setup

For optimal performance and smooth execution, we recommend:
- Running the `.ipynb` notebook on **Kaggle**
- Using GPU acceleration for faster training

The Python files were converted from the notebook and may run slower on local CPUs. Use them for code reference, but for actual execution, we recommend using the notebook on Kaggle.
